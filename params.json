Over the course of 10 weeks, we learned how to use Unreal Game Engine to create a game playable on the [Oculus Rift](https://www.oculus.com/en-us/). We used Blueprints and Unreal's experimental Environment Query System to create a realistic interactive environment and spooky AI ghosties.\r\n\r\n###Demo Video:\r\n[Oculus Playthrough](https://www.dropbox.com/s/s6asyw2db2f88qt/final1.1.wmv?dl=0)\r\n\r\n###Important:\r\nWe used Unreal Engine v4.7.6. Future versions may or may not affect the performance of this game. \r\n\r\n###Controls:\r\nWASD : Move  \r\nSPACE: Jump  \r\nE: Pick up keys or open doors.   \r\nF: Toggle Flashlight. Flashlight slowly drains and charges when turned off.   \r\nR-CLICK: Toggle Camera  \r\nL-Click: Fire Camera - 10 second cooldown. Any spooky ghosts hit by camera flash are briefly stunned.  \r\n\r\n###In-Game and AI Screenshots: \r\n<blockquote class=\"imgur-embed-pub\" lang=\"en\" data-id=\"a/XtFv8\"><a href=\"//imgur.com/a/XtFv8\">CS188VR Final Screenshots</a></blockquote><script async src=\"//s.imgur.com/min/embed.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
